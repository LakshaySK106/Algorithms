# Special Note For Everyone ðŸŽƒ
```py
'''
Always make more than 4 pull requests. If you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects and one of those projects is excluded from the Hacktoberfest event, then that pull request will not be counted, leaving you with only 3 valid pull requests if those projects are not excluded.

If you fail to make 4 valid pull requests, you won't be eligible for swags or t-shirts.

I recommend that you make pull requests to your own repository, as this is a very safe option for you. Just ensure that your repository has the Hacktoberfest topic.
